And don’t get me started on those weird growths, like galls or cankers. They’ll have ya scratchin’ your head, wonderin’ what’s gone wrong. Spot these signs early, folks, ‘cause catchin’ ‘em in time can save you a whole mess of trouble down the road. Trust me, it ain’t my first rodeo when it comes to fixin’ up trees.

## Key Takeaways

Well, howdy there, folks! Let’s talk about them trees standin’ tall on your place—ya know, the ones that give shade better than a cowboy hat on a hot day. But sometimes, them trees can get a bit under the weather, just like ol’ Billy when he eats too much birthday cake.

*   If you see leaves sportin’ colors like reds and yellows, it’s like the tree’s throwin’ a hissy fit. Could be stress from drought, or maybe it’s not gettin’ the nutrients it needs, or even some pesky critters munchin’ away. Keep an eye on ‘em, just like I do when Lucy’s tryin’ to sneak another pet into the house.
*   Now, if them leaves start wilting or droppin’ like Tam’s homemade biscuits when she forgets to add the buttermilk, it’s a sign somethin’ ain’t right. You gotta check that soil moisture, ‘cause a thirsty tree ain’t gonna stick around long.
*   And if you spot any fuzzy or colorful patches on the bark, well, that’s a big ol' red flag. That fungus is yellin’ for help, and your tree needs more than just a little TLC; it needs you to step in quick!
*   Cracked or peel-y bark? That tree’s in distress, buddy. It could be a disease or those pesky bugs settlin’ in for a long visit. Time to roll up your sleeves and do a thorough check-up on that trunk.
*   Lastly, if you see any weird growths or tumors, like galls or cankers, it’s time to call in the big guns—‘cause I reckon it’s beyond our DIY skills. A professional will know just how to nurse your tree back to health.
