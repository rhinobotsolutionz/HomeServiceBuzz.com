And if you’re tight on space, a portable option’s your best buddy. But if you need something that can withstand the test of time, a commercial-grade pressure washer will bring the heat and last longer than a Michigan winter.

Don’t forget to check the essentials: pressure settings, hose length, and how easy it is to maneuver. Stick around, and I’ll break down each type and show you what makes them tick. Trust me, knowing your gear is half the battle.

Flow rate and nozzle types? Don’t skip those. They’re your best friends in getting the job done right. Different tasks call for different setups—just like you wouldn’t wear the same shoes to a job site as you would to a family dinner.

Portable pressure washers are a lifesaver for tight spaces. They store easy and roll out quick, perfect for light to moderate jobs. You know how it is—sometimes you just gotta grab what you can and go.
