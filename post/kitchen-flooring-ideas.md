Now, let’s talk protection. It’s like giving your beloved floors a big hug! Place mats at entryways to catch those pesky outside particles, and don’t forget to use felt pads under furniture—your floors will thank you for it.

Also, watch out for excessive moisture; like a surprise rainstorm, it can warp the wood if you’re not careful.
